# Configuration file for the color ls utility
# Synchronized with coreutils 8.5 dircolors
# This file goes in the /etc directory, and must be world readable.
# You can copy this file to .dir_colors in your $HOME directory to override
# the system defaults.

# COLOR needs one of these arguments: 'tty' colorizes output to ttys, but not
# pipes. 'all' adds color characters to all output. 'none' shuts colorization
# off.
COLOR tty

# Extra command line options for ls go here.
# Basically these ones are:
#  -F = show '/' for dirs, '*' for executables, etc.
#  -T 0 = don't trust tab spacing when formatting ls output.
OPTIONS -F -T 0

# Below, there should be one TERM entry for each termtype that is colorizable

# Below are the color init strings for the basic file types. A color init

# Text color codes:

# Background color codes:
# 40=black 41=red 42=green 43=yellow 44=blue 45=magenta 46=cyan 47=white

#NORMAL 00	# no color code at all
#FILE 00	# normal file, use no color at all
RESET 0 # reset to "normal" color
DIR 00;34	# directory
LINK 00;36  # symbolic link (If you set this to 'target' instead of a
            # numerical value, the color is as for the file pointed to.)
MULTIHARDLINK 00	# regular file with more than one link
FIFO 40;33	# pipe
SOCK 00;35	# socket
DOOR 00;35	# door
BLK 40;33;01	# block device driver
CHR 40;33;01	# character device driver
ORPHAN 40;31  # symlink to nonexistent file, or non-stat'able file
MISSING 00;05;37;41 # ... and the files they point to
SETUID 37;41	# file that is setuid (u+s)
SETGID 33	# file that is setgid (g+s)
CAPABILITY 30;41	# file with capability
STICKY_OTHER_WRITABLE 30;42 # dir that is sticky and other-writable (+t,o+w)
OTHER_WRITABLE 34;42 # dir that is other-writable (o+w) and not sticky
STICKY 37;44	# dir with the sticky bit set (+t) and not other-writable

# This is for files with execute permission:
